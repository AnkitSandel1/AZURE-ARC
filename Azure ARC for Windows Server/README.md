# Windows Server Agent Overview

The Windows Server agent is a program you install on a Windows Server to connect it to Azure Arc. Think of it as a bridge that allows your server to communicate with Azure. This agent, called the hybrid instance metadata service, talks to Azure Resource Manager and Azure Active Directory over a secure connection (port 443). It also has a feature called an extension manager, which can install and manage additional tools from Azure, like Azure Monitor for monitoring your server or Azure Defender for security.
